### About Me
I am an experienced and solution-oriented GIS Analyst who is passionate about providing simple digital solutions to complex environmental and spatial problems

I am a PhD student at [Boise State Unuiversity] (https://www.boisestate.edu/earth/staff-members/graduate-students/). 

### Skills
- ðŸŒ± Remote Sensing and GIS Analysis
- ðŸ“« Machine Learning
- ðŸ”­ Big Earth Data Analysis
- ðŸ“« Web Development


### Research Interest
My research interest covers the broad spectrum of cryosphere, polar oceanograhy, environmental science and climate change with focus on snow hydrology. I am currently conducting research on interferometric synthetic aperture radar InSAR and Machine Learning techniques for retrieving snow parameters.
