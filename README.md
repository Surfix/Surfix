### Research Interest
One of the greatest uncertainties in modelling sea level rise is the limited understanding of the contributions from mass water addition from the melting of glaciers and sea ice. So, my research interest covers the broad spectrum of polar oceanogaphy with focus on Iceberg production and evolution, sea level rise and ocean-glacier interactions.
